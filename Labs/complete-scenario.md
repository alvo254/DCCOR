## Scenario: Implementing Routing in the Data Center

### Overview


### In this advanced data center scenario, you are tasked with implementing a highly available, resilient, and scalable routing solution that includes various dynamic routing protocols, redundancy mechanisms, and multicast support. You will configure multiple routing protocols, including BGP, RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, and integrate BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) for fast failure detection. VRRP will be used for router redundancy, and multicast will be enabled for streaming media and application support.

### Network Design

- **Core Router (R1):** The primary router that connects the internal data center to external networks and handles route redistribution.
- **Edge Router (R2):** The router that connects the data center to external networks and acts as the border gateway for BGP.
- **Access Routers (R3, R4):** These routers handle routing for application zones.
- **Management VLAN (VLAN 10):** Used by network management devices.
- **Application VLAN (VLAN 20):** Used by application servers.
- **Storage VLAN (VLAN 30):** Used for storage devices.
- **Security VLAN (VLAN 40):** Used for security monitoring devices.
- **Multicast Source (R5):** A device that sends multicast traffic.
- **Multicast Receiver (R6):** A device that receives multicast traffic.

### Requirements

1. **IP Addressing:**
    
    - R1: 192.168.1.1/24 (Management interface)
    - R2: 192.168.2.1/24 (Edge interface)
    - R3: 192.168.10.1/24 (Application subnet)
    - R4: 192.168.20.1/24 (Application subnet)
    - VLAN 10: 192.168.10.0/24
    - VLAN 20: 192.168.20.0/24
    - VLAN 30: 192.168.30.0/24
    - VLAN 40: 192.168.40.0/24
    - Multicast group: 225.1.1.1 (source), 225.1.1.2 (receiver)
2. **Routing Protocols:**
    
    - **RIP** on R3, R4, and R1 for basic internal routing.
    - **OSPF** on R1 and R2 to provide scalable external routing to other parts of the network.
    - **BGP** between R2 and the external ISP router to exchange routing information for external networks.
    - **EIGRP** on R1, R3, and R4 to support faster convergence in data center environments.
    - **BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)** to enable faster failure detection between R1 and R2, improving convergence times.
3. **Route Redistribution:**
    
    - Redistribute routes between RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP to ensure all devices have a complete routing table.
    - Use **Route Maps** to control which routes are redistributed and to apply policy-based routing.
4. **Redundancy and High Availability:**
    
    - Implement **VRRP** for router redundancy between R1 and R2 to ensure that a failure of one router does not impact connectivity.
    - Configure **HVRP (Hot Standby Routing Protocol)** between R1 and R2 to ensure redundant paths and automatic failover in case of a failure.
    - Use **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)** routing for load balancing between R1, R3, and R4.
5. **Multicast Routing:**
    
    - Enable **PIM-SM (Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode)** on routers R1, R3, R4, and R5 to support multicast routing.
    - Configure **IGMP Snooping** on switches to ensure that multicast traffic is sent only to devices that need it.
    - Verify multicast traffic forwarding from R5 (source) to R6 (receiver).
6. **Default Routing:**
    
    - Configure a **default route** on R1 pointing to R2 for external network access.
    - Set up a **default route** on R2 for internet connectivity.
7. **Troubleshooting and Monitoring:**
    
    - Use **ping**, **traceroute**, and **show ip route** to verify routing table entries and network connectivity.
    - Configure **SNMP** and **syslog** to monitor network performance and health.
    - Implement **NetFlow** for traffic analysis and **Flow Spec** to control traffic behavior.
8. **Security and Traffic Control:**
    
    - Implement **ACLs** (Access Control Lists) to filter traffic between VLANs and control access to the multicast traffic.
    - Use **Route Maps** and **Policy-Based Routing** (PBR) to control which routes are used by different VLANs, ensuring optimal routing.

### Tasks to Accomplish

1. **Configure RIP on R1, R3, and R4:**
    
    - Enable RIP on R1, R3, and R4, and define the appropriate networks.
    - Verify RIP propagation across the network and ensure that all internal routers can reach each other's networks.
2. **Configure OSPF on R1 and R2:**
    
    - Set up OSPF on R1 and R2 to exchange external routing information.
    - Verify OSPF adjacency between R1 and R2.
3. **Configure EIGRP on R1, R3, and R4:**
    
    - Enable EIGRP on R1, R3, and R4, and configure proper metric settings for optimal routing.
4. **Configure BGP on R2 and External Router:**
    
    - Set up BGP on R2 to establish a peering relationship with the external ISP router.
    - Advertise internal routes and receive external routes.
5. **Implement Route Redistribution Between RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP:**
    
    - Use the `redistribute` command to allow routes from RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP to be redistributed between the routers.
    - Apply route maps to filter and control the redistribution process.
6. **Enable BFD for Fast Failure Detection on R1 and R2:**
    
    - Configure BFD on the link between R1 and R2 for rapid failure detection and faster convergence.
7. **Configure VRRP for Router Redundancy:**
    
    - Implement VRRP on R1 and R2 for high availability. R1 will be the primary router, and R2 will be the backup.
8. **Configure ECMP for Load Balancing:**
    
    - Enable ECMP on R1 for traffic balancing between R1, R3, and R4.
9. **Configure Multicast (PIM-SM) on R1, R3, R4, and R5:**
    
    - Enable **PIM-SM** on R1, R3, R4, and R5 to support multicast routing.
    - Set up **IGMP Snooping** on the switches to ensure multicast traffic is only forwarded to the necessary receivers.
10. **Verify Multicast Forwarding from R5 to R6:**
    
    - Verify that multicast traffic from R5 reaches R6 successfully using **show ip mroute** and **show ip igmp groups**.
11. **Monitor and Troubleshoot the Network:**
    
    - Use **ping**, **traceroute**, and **show ip protocols** to ensure routing protocols are functioning correctly.
    - Set up SNMP for real-time monitoring of network devices and traffic.
